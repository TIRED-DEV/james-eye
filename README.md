# Learning through the looking glass

A didactic game to raise awareness about the possibilities offered by the James Webb telescope. The players' aim is to guess with which telescope each of the photos — depicting celestial bodies — was taken. Moreover, they have the opportunity to learn the basics about the telescope in an approachable way.

Our public target is people who are interested in space but still in the dark about the huge steps in space exploration that can be offered by a telescope of this magnitude.
